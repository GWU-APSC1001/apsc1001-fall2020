APSC 1001 has a longstanding tradition of recognizing student participation, engagement, and creativity with "brownie points". Moving the class online means tweaking the tradition a little, so here we're featuring student-made [Thunkable assignment](list/assignments.html) submissions that we felt were exceptionally creative and beyond the scope of what we were expecting.

Of course, it's always difficult to pick the top 4 out of so many excellent creations -- [we](/contact.html) love seeing your hard work, even if it isn't showcased here!

We'll keep this page updated as we get more assignment submissions.
